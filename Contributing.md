## Branches ##
Course consist from 2 branches 

- master - for questions
- answers - example answers implementations

## PRs ##
PRs are very welcome. They are a bit tricky though as project development goes in 2 branches.

In case if you want to extend the course please commit to answers branch. 
Then merge it to master and wipe out questions. 
After that create 2 PRs - one for master and one for answers.
